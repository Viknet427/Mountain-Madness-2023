# Mountain-Madness-2023
Spring 2023 Hackathon at SFU

## Brief Description
Welcome to BOGO translate! Every wondered what "Hello" is in 50 dfferent languages?<br />
Wonder no more! Now you're forced to sit through and find out..

## What It Does
This programm takes two inputs i.e. a given phrase from the user as well as the intended language the user would like to translate. From these two inputs the program will translate the phrase into languages different from what the user specified before finally translating it into the desired language. We feel this best fits the theme 'Lost in Translation' because the meaning and nuances of sentences are often lost when translating from language to language. In the real world, this happens quite frequently so we wanted to represent this concept using this project. The user will be able to see how much of their original prompt has changed and will be able to go through an enlightening and fun experience, observing the technicalities of languages.

## Technologies 
To bring this vision to life we utilised a variety of both front-end and back-end technologies. For the back-end we used JavaScript in order to make the website interactable and the Microsoft Azure Translator API to convert our given text into different languages. While for the front-end we used HTML and CSS to create an aesthetic user interface that shows off our school spirit. We also integrated Bootstrap into our framework to make our website fully responsisve for both mobile and desktop applications.

## Difficulties
Even though we managed to complete the 3 sections of our translator (the website, the spell checker, and the translator), we were unable to integrate all the components into a cohesive unit by the deadline. Each aspect may be functionable but they cannot be run together just yet.

## Accomplishments
While our team may be inexperienced in web development, we decided to challenge ourselves and create this website for our project. Half our team had little experience in web development, but the outcome has reached our expectations as much as we could hope for. We were also able to learn and apply the Microsoft Azure Translator API in under 24 hours so that is something for our team to be proud of.

## What We Learnt
Our team learnt a lot about web development, utilizing APIs, and working together as a team using Live Share and GitHub. We coordinated our workload efficiently and pitched in new ideas to solve our problems. In the end, we had a better foundation on the basics of creating a website and applying APIs into projects.

## What is Next for BOGO translate
We hope to improve BOGO translate to be able to run everything on one website. Another course of actions is learning how to implement a spell checker to provide translations with a better prompt. Fixing up the code to make it more presentable and efficiently commented is one of our other future goals.
